------------
This project aims to make superstore management easier for administrators, store owners and distributors, which helps them to monitor their products, stocks and deliveries at their fingertips without my delay in updated info status and also without having to depend on the paper oriented ledgers for record maintenance.

The users need to Sign-Up to ask or answer their respective queries. 
The users use their user id and password to login. 
The administrator can create new store owners and distributors.

### Back End
The back-end database used in this project is MySQL it is a language used to interrogate and
process data in a relational database.
Originally developed by IBM for its mainframes, SQL commands can be used to interactively
work with a database or can be embedded within a script or programming language as an
interface to a database.
Programming extensions to SQL have turned it into a full- blown database programming
language, and all major database management systems (DBMSs) support it.
ANSI standardized SQL. But most DBMSs have some propriety enhancement, which if used,
makes SQL non-standard.
Moving an application from one SQL database o another sometimes requires tweaking, the age-
old problem in this business!
